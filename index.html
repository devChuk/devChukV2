						Hey. I'm a software developer & elecrical engineer. This will be my sophomore year at <span id="detail1">New York University</span>.

						This website is my playground.<br>It's a sandbox for the work I create, and a home for my writing. It's a journal for my past, and a forecast for my future.

						I'm currently a Computer Science Major in the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering. A couple courses that I have taken are Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures & Algorithms.<br><br>
						As of now, most of what I've learned in programming has come from self-teaching. I'm a strong believer in learning by doing and taking education into your own hands.
