It's easy to bookmark and save too many articles with content-savers such as Pocket&mdash;and never read any of them.

Finch is an application that summarizes articles so you can spend less time reading and more time on the things that matter more. It also saves your summaries so you don't even need an Internet connection.

Features:

- a text box to input article URLs to genereate summaries
- a sharing intent so you can share links to Finch from any other application
- it uses the Aylien text analysis API to generate summaries
- tapping the link redirects you to the original article

This application is actually just a submission for Capital One's Software Engineering Summit's [Final Round Challenge](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/565). You can learn more about the conference [here](https://youtu.be/c5efHTl40dE). It's been pretty useful for me and I might put it up on the App Store after polishing it. For now, if you'd like to use the app you can install the APK on the Github link.
