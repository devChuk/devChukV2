3D modelling and printing has been something that I've always been working with for a while. I've used it in research, at work, and at school projects. So when I saw that [MHacks V](http://mhacks.org/) was lending these augmented reality [Meta Glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7I7JuQXttw), I wanted to experience a 3D modelling tool in a totally new form.

That's what Creation is. My team and I wanted to make a tool so easy that no training was required to create 3D models.

In Creation there's a bunch of basic actions you can do with your hands to interact with objects. You can move objects around by grabbing them and dragging them around. If you use two hands to grab the object, rotating your fists also rotates the object. If you move your fists further apart, you're able to make the object bigger or smaller.

On the left side there's a floating menu that lets you create basic objects: cubes, spheres, and cylinders.

You can also 'lock' shapes together and save your project.

The right panel's pretty interesting. Poke two points on it and it'll draw a flat rectangle with a diagonal that's the distance between those two points. If you pinch the rectangle and drag it towards you, the rectangle will *extrude* into a three dimensional rectangular prism.
