Our group final project for Stuyvesant's Software Development class. We made two Rock 'Em Sock 'Em style robots that were able to be controlled via the Internet. The robots were made out of polycarbonate rectangles glued together with 3D printed fists. They were able to throw punches with servo motors and an Arduino.
