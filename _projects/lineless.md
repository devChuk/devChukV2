Lineless is a web app I made at [Battlehack Boston](https://2014.battlehack.org/boston) that eliminates waiting in restaurants and delis. The way it works is by having users order the food (and pay for it online) they want before they enter the restaurant. When the vendor is done preparing the food, the user gets notified by an automated text message.

**Tech:** Firebase, NodeJS, AngularJS, Venmo, Twilio, Javascript, HTML, CSS
