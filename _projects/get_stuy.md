GET_STUY was a small hack I made within an hour during [HackBCA](http://www.hackbca.com/) that was a spoof of a massive fad in 2014, [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/). Instead of matching numbers together to create bigger numbers, players would match New York City public high school logos together to create other public high schools. In order to win the game, you must continue to match public high school logos until you create the logo of the ultimate school: Stuyvesant.

The game got popular very quickly (over a couple thousand unique visitors) and I can say with pride and shame that I have successfully wasted the time of so many other people with this addicting game.
