After a Science Olympiad meeting in my sophomore year of high school, my friend Patrick and I found a drawer full of scrap wood. I picked up a small square of wood, made a few cuts, and tied a rubber band to it.

We tried to fire some thin balsa sticks, but they would just flutter out of the makeshift pistol; it was a primitive beginning.

The next day, I walked in and saw Patrick building something I've never seen before. It was a wooden T, where the vertical part of the T had a slot to house the projectiles and the horizontal portion had a long loop of rubber tied to both ends. It was a crossbow! And it was able to fire those thin balsa sticks fairly well! I got excited and started to build my own crossbow right away. A couple more friends joined us and soon Science Olympiad had a firing range and an 'armory' (the top shelf on the cabinet below) full of weapons.

To be honest, it became a bit of an obsession. We created more and more crossbows, all with different mechanisms and ridiculous features. We added scopes, longer barrels for accuraccy, ergonomic leather handles, and actual triggers. There was one I made called the Force of Nature,
