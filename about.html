							I was born in 1996 in New York City and grew up in various neighborhoods there. My interest in programming came in a rather roundabout/indirect way. Back in Stuyvesant High School, I teamed up with some close friends and built drones & robotic arms. That progressed into doing research in the Mechatronics Lab in NYU & building flying drones for Kite & Rocket, the product development firm behind the Nerf gun lines.
							<br><br>
							The plan was to become an electrical engineering major but that changed after my first hackathon in February 2014. I got hooked/obsessed. I spent the next 12 months travelling around during my weekends to attend around 21 hackathons. During that time, I met tons of inspirational people and learned a lot of swag.
							<br><br>
							This year, I became a developer evangelist for Syncano, an European DaaS, and received the hackNY fellowship to live in Union Square and complete a technical internship. I worked at Betterpath, a healthcare startup that simplifies patients' medical records and aims to use data science to find patterns in uncurable diseases.
							<br><br>
							I entered New York University in 2014 as a Computer Science Major.
							<br><br>
							Outside of programming, I do all this other stuff.
