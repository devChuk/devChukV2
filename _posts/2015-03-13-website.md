title: Let's build a website
---


Hey! This is a blog post I will keep updating as I work on the second version of my website. Hopefully it'll teach you one or two things about design.

Before we even go into coding at all, we'll have to look into design. Why is design important? Design is what gives a product a polished feeling. It attracts users (just look at Apple) and makes things dummy-proof. In fact, design may even be just as important as programming. At the [McHacks](http://mchacks.io/) hackathon in Montreal, the main reason why my team won third place was because of [how polished it looked](http://challengepost.com/software/parrot-30p8h).

We'll have to understand what how design affect the final product, and then determine the design factors for our website.

So before we start, let's do some homework. I haven't read through all these links myself to be honest but they seem to be useful(trust me most of it is pretty entertaining I think):

* [How Pictures Work](http://johnsonsr.spps.org/uploads/molly_bang_how_pictures_work.pdf)
* Go through a few of [these tutorials](http://design.tutsplus.com/articles/50-totally-free-lessons-in-graphic-design-theory--psd-2916) everyday
* [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda)
* [Fonts I always consider using](http://imgur.com/gallery/MPSSfXj)

<!---excerpt--> 
* [UX Recipe](http://uxrecipe.github.io/)
* [UI Interaction Library](http://useyourinterface.com/)
* [User Interfaces IO](http://userinterfaces.io/)

Done? Now that we have some basic design concepts, let's do what professional design firms call "competitive research." Basically we're going to look at other websites that satisfy a similar goal and see what neat design elements they have.

That's all for now. I'll update this another night.
