title: Lessons From hackNY

If you don't know what the [hackNY Fellowship](hackny.org/a/fellows/) is, it's a program that pairs quantitative and computational students with startups which can demonstrate a strong mentoring environment: a problem for a student to work on, a person to mentor them, and a place for them to work. Students enjoy free housing together over the course of 10 weeks and a pedagogical lecture series to introduce them to the ins and outs of joining and founding a startup.

I was pretty confident with what I wanted to do with my life before this summer but thanks to my experiences I've been constantly questioning my potential career paths and thinking pretty deeply about the kind of person I want to become. A friend has asked me what I've learned this summer, so here goes. These lessons and ideas originate from lectures, readings, and friends. They go over a broad range of topics, from running a startup to just living life. I feel a little hesitant sharing this list, but here's a cleaned up version.

* Ask yourself everyday: Am I doing exactly what I want to be doing?

* Design for a vision, not just usability or prettiness. If you look at comments on Youtube, they're usually flame wars full of hate because users can easily leave negative comments on videos. Tumblr solves this by completely removing the commenting system. In order to reply to a post, users have to repost it. As a result, it's hard to find negative content on Tumblr blogs.

* Hire people who you wouldn't mind having as your boss. Leave your position with someone better than you.

* If you're wondering whether to fire someone, do it

* *"Never stand up when you can sit down. And never sit down when you can lie down."* —Winston Churchill

* To lead a company is to be fairly transparent. Let people be autonomous. Sharing your thoughts is more powerful than just giving orders.

* In YCombinator interviews they just repeat the application questions & ask why 5 times:

> > *What is your company going to make?*

> > Tinder for Blue Whales.

> > *Why is your company making this?*

> > It's something people want.

> > *Why do people want this?...*

* *"Why the fuck else would you even want to be alive but to do things as well as you can? Now: let’s do this."* —Stewart Butterfield

* *"Union Square Ventures in 140 characters: invest in large networks of engaged users, differentiated by user experience, and defensible though network effects"* —Brad Burnham

> > For instance, when I look up an item on Google Search, Google tracks the actions I take and use the data to improve the search experience for when others look up the same item. Links are suggested based on indirect actions of other users.

* Careers and jobs and employers and technologies all come and go.

> Figure out what interests you yourself, whether you want to go somewhere or do something, and how you might get there. What's important to you.

> If your current job can or does line up with that, great. If not, then start working toward your target and toward a different role at your employer, a different employer, or self-employment.

> Have enough cash and/or short-term assets available to operate for at least six months without a job. Maybe longer, depending on what the job market looks like in your area.

> As for yourself: diet, exercise, regular sleep and regular meals, and working sane hours. Work on your own mental, social, and physical health. Your finances and your cash flow and your sleep and your meal schedules are all part of this health, too.

> Schedule time for yourself. Outside of your job. Both to learn and grow, and for socializing. Seek out folks that will challenge you — either at work, at university, at a Maker's event, or outside. Seek out and talk with folks of different backgrounds and interest areas and any of the different genders and of different personal histories and experiences. Learn a new language.

> Once you have pondered on these and have your plans underway, then you can start working on the technologies and the tools and the online courses and classes and the rest. If they're applicable, and how you best learn.

> While your employer will certainly like the focus on your career, life is more about yourself.

There's one thing that's obvious but necessary to remember. Being enthusiastic about the IDEA of doing stuff is easy, Actually DOING it is another story.

It's terrifying looking at all the goals I said that I'd complete in the past but never actually achieved. I get that not all plans carry through, but what depresses me is that I never even tried to work towards those goals.

This isn't a problem that can be solved by writing a hollow vow on a blog post. But it's something I can show that I'm improving on by writing updates on this site. This time, I'm not going to have regrets of things I didn't try.
