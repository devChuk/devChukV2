If you don't know what the [hackNY Fellowship](hackny.org/a/fellows/) is, it's a program that pairs quantitative and computational students with startups which can demonstrate a strong mentoring environment: a problem for a student to work on, a person to mentor them, and a place for them to work. Students enjoy free housing together over the course of 10 weeks and a pedagogical lecture series to introduce them to the ins and outs of joining and founding a startup. 

I was pretty confident with what I wanted to do with my life before this summer but thanks to hackNY I've been constantly questioning my potential career paths and thinking pretty deeply about the kind of person I want to become. A friend has asked me what lessons I've picked up this summer, so here goes. These lessons go over a broad range of topics, from running a startup to just living life.

* Ask yourself everyday: Am I doing what I want to be doing?

* Design for a vision, not just usability or prettiness. If you look at comments on Youtube, they're usually flame wars full of hate. In Tumblr, there is no commenting system. Users have to repost something back into their blog, which minimizes negative comments.

* Hire people who you wouldn't mind having as your boss

* If you're wondering whether to fire someone, do it

* Investors are constantly evaluating you. Thus, they can't help you. Therefore, you can't tell them your problems

* There will be times in a startup when you have to work crazy hours. During the times you don't have to, work normal hours. As Winston Churchill once said: "Never stand up when you can sit down. And never sit down when you can lie down."

* Lowest level of satisfaction...#Needs explanation

* To lead a company is to be fairly transparent. Let people be pretty autonomous. Oversharing & emails & saying thoughts is more useful than just giving orders.

* In YCombinator interviews they just repeat the application questions & ask why 5 times

* What do you want to do when you start a company? Make money? Or make something that matters & is lasting?

* Network effects are powerful. In Google Search, when I search a term and choose a link, Google uses my actions to improve the search experience for when you use Google. My actions indirectly benefits your experience.

* Careers and jobs and employers and technologies all come and go.

* Figure out what interests you yourself, whether you want to go somewhere or do something, and how you might get there. What's important to you.

* If your current job can or does line up with that, great. If not, then start working toward your target and toward a different role at your employer, a different employer, or self-employment.

* Have enough cash and/or short-term assets available to operate for at least six months without a job. Maybe longer, depending on what the job market looks like in your area.

* As for yourself: diet, exercise, regular sleep and regular meals, and working sane hours. Work on your own mental, social, and physical health. Your finances and your cash flow and your sleep and your meal schedules are all part of this health, too.

* Schedule time for yourself. Outside of your job. Both to learn and grow, and for socializing. Seek out folks that will challenge you — either at work, at university, at a Maker's event, or outside. Seek out and talk with folks of different backgrounds and interest areas and any of the different genders and of different personal histories and experiences. Learn a new language.

* Once you have pondered on these and have your plans underway, then you can start working on the technologies and the tools and the online courses and classes and the rest. If they're applicable, and how you best learn.

* While your employer will certainly like the focus on your career, life is more about yourself.

* The reality is that no one is going to help you get the things you want in life. You have to seize the moment yourself.

I think the lesson that struck me the most is that it's so easy to say that I'm going to do something but not actually do it.
