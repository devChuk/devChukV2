To be honest, I've been stagnating since the middle of fall semester. I just lost interest in coding. Last year, I added seven projects to my website between September and February. This year, it's already February and there's only one project on here.

I've been slacking in school too. Although I don't make my grades a priority, they've dipped below even 
<a id="show_id" onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler_id').style.display=='none')document.getElementById('spoiler_id').style.display='';else document.getElementById('spoiler_id').style.display='none';" class="link" style="cursor:pointer">my standards</a>.

It's hard to explain exactly why&#8212;in the end there's probably multiple reasons. For starters, I've had terrible time management. Classes and assignments also take more time now compared to freshman year. Back then, I had already taught myself what they were teaching in class and so I <a id="show_id" onclick="if(document.getElementById('spoiler_id1').style.display=='none')document.getElementById('spoiler_id1').style.display='';else document.getElementById('spoiler_id1').style.display='none';" class="link" style="cursor:pointer">rarely attended them</a><img id="spoiler_id1" style="display: none; width: auto; height: 1em;" src="http://www.brianch.uk/res/img/blog/smirk.png">&#8212;I did well in my grades anyways. Now, I actually don't know what's going on so I'm focusing more on school. I suppose I've also been bogged down by work and trying to organize a hackathon for NYU.

Perhaps it's also due to the [environment](http://www.brianch.uk/blog/2014/09/14/MhacksIv-and-College/) I'm in. It's hard being here when very few students actually take the initiative to learn and create outside of the classroom. It's cliche but it's  true: you are the average of the people you spend the most time with. In freshman year I spent a lot of weekends at [hackathons](http://www.brianch.uk/blog/2015/12/02/Hackathon-History/) and was constantly inspired and encouraged to keep creating and growing. Maybe I just need to get back into that.

So on January 22nd I boarded a bus to Philadelphia for [PennApps](pennapps.com). I was registered as a [Hacker Guru](http://2016s.pennapps.com/#learn), but my assigned team cancelled their attendance the night before. Luckily, I met three sophomores from Columbia University on the bus and mentored them. It was their first time at a hackathon.

At first, we tried to make a real-time multi-player game, but soon learned that our idea was too complex to execute. So we pivoted into a website that served as a dining tool for Columbia students. It scraped from [dining.columbia.edu](http://dining.columbia.edu/) and enabled users to set favorites & filter by their food restrictions. We never got to implement this part, but the idea was to notify students via email or text when their favorite food was being served.

The hackers ended up learning Flask and webdev as well as good debugging/code practices. Although it was a simple project. It was really refreshing: seeing the team get so excited about what it was making reminded me of what I loved so much about creation. It was a reminder of how it felt to **love an idea enough to dedicate 48 hours straight to learning whatever was needed to build it.** I think that's what I've been missing&#8212;I've been taking side projects too seriously. I was focusing on what I could gain out of my work (professional dev & portfolio growth) rather than just having fun with something I personally found meaningful.

I'm slowly getting things back together and putting myself into places outside my comfort zone. I'm joining the [NYU Hyperloop team](http://engineering.nyu.edu/news/2016/02/10/tandon-team-advances-international-hyperloop-design-competition) this semester to build a 1:5 scale Hyperloop prototype and work with FPGAs. We've made it into the finals and we'll be competing on Elon Musk's mile-long test track this summer. I'm also hanging around in the [ISIS lab](http://www.isis.poly.edu/) more to dabble into cybersecurity, and I've started a weekly workshop series in NYU where we teach students how to code anything. And as a late new year's resolution, I'll try to code daily and keep up a commit streak. Of course it doesn't mean anything, but it's a reminder. A reminder to continue to create and enjoy the process.

I'm looking forward to it.
