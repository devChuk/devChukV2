To kick off this new site, I feel that I should check back on these past several months. It's crazy seeing how things change in such a short period.

Let's go back a year.

College admissions came out recently, and I received rejection after rejection while watching all my friends get accepted to Ivy League schools&mdash;it was a pretty terrible time. I think I reached a low point when I accepted an invitation to a college that I previously said that I didn't want to go to: Polytechnic Institute of New York University. I didn't have a choice; I was accepted into UIUC and a couple colleges in California but various reasons required me to live closer to home.

I wanted to get out of the city and spend some time away from it in a college campus. Here, there isn't even a campus. I was expected to spend four years of my life in just three buildings: Clark Hall, my dorm; Bern Dibner Library, which also houses a lecture hall; and 6 Metrotech, where I took most of my classes.

The start of college revealed that NYUPoly wasn't all that bad, though there were things that seriously [needed change](http://tumblr.sergeydgr8.com/post/83578963114/my-thoughts-on-poly). I wasn't learning. I had a lecture dedicated entirely to how to use Microsoft Word and a mathematics professor that would assign homework and exams and *then* teach us how to do them. There were weekly disputes with a professor in recitation whenever he pointed out that my team missed something in our presentations, when in reality we actually had it.

I know, it's not fair to judge an entire school's classes by a bunch of courses in freshman year. But what if my future classes are like the ones I had? What if my four years of college are going to be like this? I can't even imagine that.

I needed a way out.

That's where [hackathons](http://www.brianch.uk/devchukV1/blog/2014/09/28/hacklife/) came in. I went to my first one in February 2014, and I got hooked. They were an escape from the monotony of classes, a way for me to learn. To build. To have adventures with all these talented and cool people.

From that point to this day, I've showed up to

</ol>

If I was able to give advice to myself one year ago, I wouldn't have anything to say. I'm content with where I am and the direction I think I'm moving towards.

So what's next? I'll build even cooler stuff and have more adventures with awesome people. The point of this website is to record exactly that. There's a huge list of ideas I'd like to try out, and now's the best time to get started.
