To kick off this new site, I feel that I should check back on these past several months. It's crazy seeing what can happen in such a short time; I would have never predicted the things I'm doing right now.

Let's go back a year.

College admissions came out recently, and I received rejection after rejection while watching all my friends get accepted to Ivy League schools&mdash;it was a pretty terrible time. I think I reached a low point when I accepted an invitation to a college that I previously said that I didn't want to go to: Polytechnic Institute of New York University. I didn't have a choice; I was accepted into UIUC and a couple colleges in California but my parents wanted me to live closer to home.

I had wanted to get out of the city and spend some time away from it in a more secluded college campus. Here, there isn't even a campus. I was expected to spend four years of my life in just three buildings: Clark Hall, my dorm; Bern Dibner Library, which also houses a lecture hall; and 6 Metrotech, where I took most of my classes.

The start of college revealed that NYUPoly wasn't all that bad, though there were things that seriously [needed improvement](http://tumblr.sergeydgr8.com/post/83578963114/my-thoughts-on-poly). I had a lecture dedicated entirely to how to use Microsoft Word and a mathematics professor that would assign homework and exams and *then* teach us how to do them. The student body is also, while enthusiastic about the IDEA of doing stuff, generally balks at actually DOING anything. Adding onto all that, I wasn't learning. 

I know, it's not fair to judge an entire school's classes by a bunch of courses in freshman year. But what if they were like the ones I had? What if my four years were going to be like this?

I needed a way out.

That's where [hackathons](http://www.brianch.uk/devchukV1/blog/2014/09/28/hacklife/) came in. I went to my first one in February 2014, and that's how the story began.

From that point to now, I've showed up to

I'd spend my weekends travelling everywhere in the US and Canada for free. I had games of tennis at 2 in the morning and saw a couple deer in Michigan. The poutine up in Toronto was amazing, and the walks in Cornell's autumn campus stunning. I've been to rap battles and late night longboarding in Yale plus sledding in the hills of Montreal.

The trips weren't even the best part. I had so much fun building neat things and meeting all these motivated and smart people.

And that's what I want to spend this next year doing: building even cooler stuff and meeting smart people. I have a huge list of ideas I'd like to try out, and now's the time to get started.
