It's been a crazy weekend.

I applied for a techy/startupy meetup called [Interact 2016](joininteract.com). It's an event where you stay at Lake Tahoe, California for 4 days in February, go snowboarding, play ultimate frisbee, have dinners with big VC firms, and chill with 99 other really cool young people.

I made it into the final round, but there was one more thing to do:
"As the last step, please share a 2-minute video introducing yourself and telling us about something that interests you. (Seriously, anything that interests you, technology-related or not.)"

I decided to try something different.
