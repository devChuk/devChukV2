It's been a crazy weekend.

I applied for a techy/startupy meetup called [Interact 2016](http://joininteract.com). It's an event where you stay at Lake Tahoe, California for 4 days in February, go snowboarding, play ultimate frisbee, have dinners with big VC firms, and chill with 99 other really cool young people.

I made it into the final round, but there was one more thing to do:
*As the last step, please share a 2-minute video introducing yourself and telling us about something that interests you. (Seriously, anything that interests you, technology-related or not.)*

I decided to try something different.

I actually got rejected. It sucksâ€”but that's okay. Most of us hate trying something new unless there's a guaranteed payoff in sight. But with that mindset, we'll never grow into the best person we can be. Despite my failure, I had fun creating this with [Genji](http://genjinoguchi.com/) and I definitey learned a lot about filming and editing.

Moving on from here, I'm going to be working on not only techy projects, but video projects as well. We'll see how things play out.
